This is the Git Hub for my advanced iOS development, to view my app, please open the ContentView.swift file. The unit tests are within the TaskManagerTasks file within the adviOSassessment2tests folder. 

Unfortunately I was having issues pushing my local changes into the GitHub repository, as after the initial commit, every time I would click to push, the history would not update :(
